2023.07.27_v1d -- implemnted subarrays for WFC3/IR

2023.06.29_v1c -- output of f,F, and P were not working; fixed!  

2023.04.18_v1b -- first major update the the code
                  * amazing that no significant updates have been needed in almost
                    a year!
                  * enable flexibility in the aperture used for fitting with
                    with PIXFIT=2x2, 3x3, 4x4, or 5x5
                  * implemented a few UVIS subarrays for "shell" outputing of
                    auxiliary images (masks, art stars, subtractions)
